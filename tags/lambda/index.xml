      <description>Intro I recently took an interest in the AWS Visual Studio extension and the AWS .NET Core SDK, and came up with this mini-project to showcase some of the neat things you can do with them. This post will show you how to build a (very basic) EC2 status monitoring portal in Blazor.
We&amp;rsquo;ll use the AWS SDK to query, start and stop instances; and CloudWatch and Lambda to trigger a custom webhook on EC2 status-changed events (the reason for that will become clear later).</description>
