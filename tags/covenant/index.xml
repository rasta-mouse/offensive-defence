      <description>Whenever we download an offensive tool from the Internet, it comes as no surprise when it gets snapped up by an anti-virus solution. AV vendors are certainly keeping a keen eye on tools posted publicly (insert conspiracy theory about Microsoft owning GitHub) and are reacting relatively quickly to push signatures for those tools. However, it&amp;rsquo;s probably fair to say that these signatures are not particularly robust, and only really serve to catch those that don&amp;rsquo;t have the skills or knowledge to make the necesary modifications.</description>
