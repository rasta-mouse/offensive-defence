      <description>Windows Architecture Primer x86 processors have 4 privilege levels, known as rings, that control access to memory and CPU operations. They range from Ring 0, the most privileged, to Ring 3.

Windows only supports Rings 0 and 3, affectionately known as Kernel and User Mode respectively. The majority of user activity will occur in Ring 3 but applications may cross into Ring 0 when calling a variety of APIs - this is required when accessing the filesystem for example.</description>

      <description>Intro The EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT process creation flag is used by the Windows CreateProcess, CreateProcessAsUser, CreateProcessWithLogonW and CreateProcessWithTokenW APIs. A common use case for attackers and malware is to specify a PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS attribute (for PPID spoofing) and a PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_MITIGATION_POLICY attribute (for BlockDLLs).
This has long been achievable in both native code and managed code (via P/Invoke), but has been somewhat elusive when it comes to D/Invoke. D/Invoke has numerous advantages over P/Invoke (from a .</description>

      <description>A little while ago I published what I described as a &amp;ldquo;barely functional module stomping in C#&amp;rdquo; proof of concept. It had a couple of (pretty bad) issues - the shellcode would execute multiple times and then crash the host process.
Ceri took an interest in the code, so we worked together to make it stable and to co-author this blog post.
What is Module Stomping? Module Stomping (which also seems to go by the names Module Overloading and DLL Hollowing), is a shellcode injection technique that works thusly:</description>
