      <description>Windows Architecture Primer x86 processors have 4 privilege levels, known as rings, that control access to memory and CPU operations. They range from Ring 0, the most privileged, to Ring 3.

Windows only supports Rings 0 and 3, affectionately known as Kernel and User Mode respectively. The majority of user activity will occur in Ring 3 but applications may cross into Ring 0 when calling a variety of APIs - this is required when accessing the filesystem for example.</description>
