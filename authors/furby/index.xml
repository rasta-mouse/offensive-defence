      <description>Welcome all! Firstly, I’d like to say I am extremely excited to be able to share my thoughts with you all. This is my first ever blog, so bear with me. The main purpose of this specific blog post is to share my experiences with military service leavers, hopefully helping them with their transition into a security role in “civi-street”. It will also shine some light on the process for non-service personnel who might be interested.</description>
